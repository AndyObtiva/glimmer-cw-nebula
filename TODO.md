# TODO

## Future Consideration

- Add a sample to show off Nebula
- Create a dependency on piecemeal Nebula widgets like `c_date_time` while removing their jars from this gem
- Implement an adapter or extra/overridden constructor for TextAssist to allow it to work the standard SWT way with (parent,style) without manually passing arguments or needing a content_provider as a 3rd argument right off the bat, yet making it configurable via a property inside the widget.
